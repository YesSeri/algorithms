## 1.1
Udfør indsættelsessortering på A = [31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58].
1,2.
[31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58]
3.
[26, 31, 41, 59, 41, 58]
4.
[26, 31, 41, 41, 59, 58]
5.
[26, 31, 41, 41, 58, 59]

## 1.2

```python
fn insertionSort
	for i = 2 to n
		key = A[i]
		j = 0
		while j > i - 1 and A[j] > key
			A [j-1] = A[j]
			j++
		A [j-1] = key
```


## 2.1
We go from `i in 0..n` and for each element we compare it to the elements to its right, `j in cur..n`.

If we find `A[i] == A[j]` we `return true`.
