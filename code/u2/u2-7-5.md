- we want to find value 0

- A[i] + A[j] + A[k] = 0

- First we sort -> log(n)\*n

- we loop through all elements, a[i] -> n

- we have another loop. one pointer j to 0 and k to A.len-1.

- while `j < k`

  - if A[i] + A[j] + A[k] > 0, k--
  - else if A[i] + A[j] + A[k] < 0, j++
  - else return true

- for each iteration of the outer for loop the while loop takes n-i time, meaning: n-1, n-2, n-3...1
